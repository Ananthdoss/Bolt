* Need to install the OpenCL 1.2 Preview, which includes support for C++ Static Kernel Language and new C++ Wrapper API.
* Document:
[ ] How to use BOLT_FUNCTOR
[ ] How to use DEFINE_TYPENAME
[ ] How to use #include files to define functor.


TODO:
* Move code from "reader.cpp" to bolt.lib file.
* Need a default CPU path if OpenCL is not available.
